The service-oriented computing environment (SORCER) is a distributed computing platform implemented in Java. It allows writing network-programs (called "exertions") that operate on wrapped applications (services) to spread across the network. SORCER is often utilized in scenarios similar to those where grids are used (grid computing) in order to run parallel tasks.
SORCER's predecessor was the federated intelligent product environment (FIPER), which was software for a GE aircraft-engine-design project funded from 1999 to 2003 by the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Advanced Technology Program.  The project followed the principal investigator, and thus SORCER Labs was founded in November 2002 at Texas Tech University (TTU); SORCER core's source code was made public in 2013 under the open source Apache license.  SORCER (and FIPER) were developed at GE from 1994 to 2002, at TTU through 2009, and since then at the United States Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL).  Other groups which have made use of SORCER include Beijing Jiaotong University in China, Cranfield University in the United Kingdom, and Ulyanovsk State University in Russia.
