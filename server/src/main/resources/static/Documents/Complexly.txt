Complexly is an American online video and audio production company, based in Missoula, Montana, and Indianapolis, Indiana. Its founders are brothers John and Hank Green (who acted as CEO until late 2023), who began their Vlogbrothers YouTube channel in 2007. In 2012, the Greens began producing educational video content with the YouTube channels Crash Course and SciShow, and in the years since have created many other channels and podcasts which have been folded into the company. Originally named EcoGeek LLC, it was founded by Hank Green to support his blog on environmental and science issues and was renamed in 2016. Also associated with the Green brothers, but separate from Complexly's operations, are  DFTBA Records, the Project for Awesome, VidCon (acquired by Viacom), and Subbable (acquired by Patreon). The company's strengths in educational content has led to production funding from Google, PBS, and the Poetry Foundation among other corporations and charitable foundations.Julie Walsh Smith became acting CEO of the company in September 2023.
