In French Gothic architecture, the Rayonnant (French pronunciation: [ʁɛjɔnɑ̃]) style is the third of the four phases of Gothic architecture in France, as defined by French scholars. Related to the English division of Continental Gothic into three phases (Early, High, Late Gothic), it is the second and larger part of High Gothic.
Prominent features of Rayonnant include development of the rose window; more windows in the upper-level clerestory; the reduction of the importance of the transept; and larger openings on the ground floor to establish greater communication between the central vessel and the side aisles. Interior decoration increased, and the decorative motifs spread to the outside, to the facade and the buttresses utilizing great scale and spatial rationalism towards a greater concern for two-dimensional surfaces and the repetition of decorative motifs at different scales. The use of tracery gradually spread from the stained glass windows to areas of stonework, and to architectural features such as gables.The first building of this style was the product of the relaunch of the upper parts of the choir of the Basilica of Saint-Denis in 1231. The major example in France are the eastern parts  Amiens Cathedral (since 1236) in contrast to its western parts (1200–1235) of Classic Gothic. The most prominent and accomplished French example wre the transepts of Notre Dame de Paris (begun 1250s), including the addition of the great rose windows. The finest example of the late Rayonnant is the royal chapel in Paris, Sainte-Chapelle, in which the upper floor has the appearance of a great cage of stained glass.The most prominent Rayonnant building outside France may be Cologne Cathedral. Its choir was built from 1248 to 1322, the decoration accomplished and partly remodeled until 1360. After an interruption from 1528 to 1832, the Cathedral was completed in 1880. The footplan with all foundations is medieval, but many details of the western parts are creations of the 19th century.
From Medieval France, the style quickly spread to England, where French Rayonnant tracery was often incorporated into more traditional English features, such as colonettes and vault ribs. Notable examples of Rayonnant in England include the Angel Choir of Lincoln Cathedral, and that of Exeter Cathedral (begun before 1280). The striking retrochoir of Wells Cathedral (begun before 1280), the choir of Saint Augustine at Bristol Cathedral, and Westminster Abbey are other important examples.After the mid-14th century, Rayonnant was gradually replaced by the more ornate and highly decorated Flamboyant style.
