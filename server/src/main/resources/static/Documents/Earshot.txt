Earshot is an American alternative metal band formed in Los Angeles in 1999. The band's lineup has changed several times during their existence, with vocalist Wil Martin being the band's sole constant member.
After signing to Warner Bros. Records, Earshot issued their debut album Letting Go (2002), which spawned the hit single "Get Away". The band's second album, Two (2004), also produced a hit single, "Wait". The band has since put out two more releases, The Silver Lining (2008), and the extended play Aftermath (2015).
