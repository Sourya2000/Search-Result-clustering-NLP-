"Strutter" is a song by the American rock band Kiss, released in 1974 on their self-titled debut album, Kiss. It was the third single released from the album and failed to chart.
"Strutter" is one of the few Kiss songs written by Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley together. Stanley wrote new lyrics to "Stanley the Parrot", a song whose music was composed by Simmons. Stanley's lyrics display his Bob Dylan influence. The song was featured in the video games Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and Guitar Hero 2.
