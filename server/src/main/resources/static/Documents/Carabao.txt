Carabao (Filipino: kalabáw; Cebuano: kábaw; Ilocano: nuang; Kapampangan: damúlag) is the Philippine English term for the water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis). In the Philippines, Carabao represents hard work.In Malaysia, carabaos are expectedly known as kerbau in Malay and are the official animal of the state of Negeri Sembilan. Water buffalos were introduced to Guam from the Philippines in the 17th century. They have acquired great cultural significance to the Chamorro people and are considered the unofficial national animal of Guam.The Military Order of the Carabao, a social club started in 1900 by American enlisted men fighting in the Philippine-American War, believes that the water buffalo symbolizes the "camaraderie that grows among members of the armed forces who face the dangers and privations of extensive military service far from home."
