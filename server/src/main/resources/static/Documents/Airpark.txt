A residential airpark (also spelled air park) is a "fly-in community". The word can also refer to a community specifically designed around an airport where the residents each would own their privately owned airplane which they park in their hangar usually attached to the home or integrated into their home. The residential airpark features one or more runways with homes adjacent to the runway.  Many fly-in communities feature a variety of amenities, such as golf course, equestrian facilities and more. Residential airparks  are usually privately owned and restricted to use by the property owners and their invited guests. Most do not include commercial operations or businesses. The communities have also become a niche real estate market, with some firms dedicated solely to these developments.
Ideas for airparks existed as early as 1944. However, the first airpark was Sierra Sky Park in Fresno, California, established in 1946. The Living With Your Plane Association estimates that there are at least 426 residential airparks in the United States. Florida is estimated to have 52 airparks, followed by Washington with 50, California with 28, and Oregon with 23.
