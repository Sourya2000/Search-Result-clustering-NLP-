An armrest is a part of a chair, where a person can rest their arms on.
Armrests are built into a large variety of chairs such as automotive chairs, armchairs, sofas, and more. Adjustable armrests are commonly found in ergonomic office chairs.
Armrests should support the forearm, which reduces neck and head pain.
