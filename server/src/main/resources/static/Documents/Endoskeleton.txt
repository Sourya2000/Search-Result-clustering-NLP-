An endoskeleton (From Greek ἔνδον, éndon = "within", "inner" + σκελετός, skeletos = "skeleton") is a structural frame (skeleton) on the inside of an animal, usually composed of mineralized tissue and overlaid by soft tissues. Endoskeletons serve as structural support against gravity and mechanical loads, and provide anchoring attachment sites for skeletal muscles to transmit force and allow movements and locomotion.
Vertebrates are the predominant animal clade with endoskeletons (made of mostly bone and sometimes cartilage), although sponges also have evolved a mesh-like form of endoskeletons made of diffuse calcite/silica structural elements called spicules, and echinoderms have a dermal calcite endoskeleton known as ossicles.
Some coleoid cephalopods (squids and cuttlefish) have an internalized vestigial aragonite/calcite-chitin shell known as gladius or cuttlebone, which can serve as muscle attachments but the main function is often to maintain buoyancy rather than to give structural support.
