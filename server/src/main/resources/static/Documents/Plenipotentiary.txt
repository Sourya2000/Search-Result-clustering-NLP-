A plenipotentiary (from the Latin plenus "full" and potens "powerful") is a diplomat who has full powersâ€”authorization to sign a treaty or convention on behalf of his or her sovereign. When used as a noun more generally, the word can also refer to any person who has full powers. As an adjective, it describes something which confers full powers, such as an edict or an assignment.
