Montjoy is a herald, or royal messenger, of the French King in William Shakespeare's play Henry V. His job is to convey the King of France (King Charles VI )'s messages, including the constable's harsh message to King Henry. However, he conveys them in such a polite and respectable way that King Henry thinks on him favourably; an example of this can be seen when King Henry tips him when he has conveyed a message.
