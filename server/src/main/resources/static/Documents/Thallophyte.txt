Thallophytes (Thallophyta, Thallophyto or Thallobionta) are a polyphyletic group of non-motile organisms traditionally described as "thalloid plants", "relatively simple plants" or "lower plants". They form a division of kingdom Plantae that include lichens and algae and occasionally bryophytes, bacteria and slime moulds. Thallophytes have a hidden reproductive system and hence they are also incorporated into the similar Cryptogamae category (together with ferns), as opposed to Phanerogamae. Thallophytes are defined by having undifferentiated bodies (thalloid, pseudotissue), as opposed to cormophytes (Cormophyta) with roots and stems. Various groups of thallophytes are major contributors to marine ecosystems.
