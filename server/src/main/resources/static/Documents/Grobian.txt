Saint Grobian (Medieval Latin, Sanctus Grobianus) is a fictional patron saint of vulgar and coarse people.  His name is derived from the Middle High German grob or grop, meaning coarse or vulgar. The Old High German cognate is gerob, gerop. The word "grobian" has thus passed into the English language as an obscure word for any crude, sloppy, or buffoonish person.
