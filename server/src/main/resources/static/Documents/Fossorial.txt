A fossorial animal (from Latin  fossor 'digger') is one that is adapted to digging and which lives primarily (but not solely) underground. Examples of fossorial vertebrates are badgers, naked mole-rats, meerkats, and mole salamanders. Among invertebrates, many molluscs (e.g., clams), insects (e.g., beetles, wasps, bees), and arachnids (e.g. spiders) are fossorial.
