In archaeology, a hammerstone is a hard cobble used to strike off lithic flakes from a lump of tool stone during the process of lithic reduction.  The hammerstone is a rather universal stone tool which appeared early in most regions of the world including Europe, India and North America.  This technology was of major importance to prehistoric cultures before the age of metalworking.
