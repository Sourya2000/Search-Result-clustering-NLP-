Carty or Carthy is a surname likely to have originated from the Irish name Ó Cárthaigh (Irish: [oː ˈkaɾˠhəj]; anglicised as O'Coraic). It took its current form Carty during later historical events when many Gaelic Irish names were anglicised. It has been speculated that some Irish immigrants to America and/or their descendants added Mc, changing their names to McCarty in the incorrect belief that they were returning the name back to its original form.
The Carty name originates from the south of the island of Ireland Wexford and could have been a subclan of the much larger McCarthy clan, and a member of the Clan Eoghanachta.  It has been recorded that the Carty clan was a scattered sept or clan in pre Norman Ireland which may have resulted from an event such as having come off the wrong end of a tribal dispute.  Carty settlements can be found across Ireland sometimes in locations that were easy to defend such as Sligo's Coney Island which hosts the remains of a small Carty settlement (town and beach). Carty is a common name today in the Irish counties of: Wexford, Cork, Sligo, Galway and Roscommon. It is common in Longford under the spelling of Carthy until the last thirty years.Carty is recorded amongst the Irish travelling (tinker) community.  There may also be an English version of the name Carty which could be derived from the English name Cartwright.
