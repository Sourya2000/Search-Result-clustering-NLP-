Terrifier is a 2016 American slasher film written and directed by Damien Leone. The film stars Jenna Kanell, Samantha Scaffidi, David Howard Thornton, and Catherine Corcoran. The plot centers on partygoer Tara Heyes (Kanell) and her sister Victoria (Scaffidi), who become targets of the enigmatic serial killer only known as Art the Clown (Thornton) on Halloween night. 
It is the first film centered on Art the Clown, second-feature-length film to include the character (after the anthology film All Hallows' Eve), fourth film and fifth installment overall (following two short films and anthology installments) in the Terrifier franchise. Leone wrote the film specifically as a means of showcasing the character of Art and his practical effects workâ€”such as the controversial hacksaw death scene. Leone has expressed regret for leaving the protagonists underdeveloped. Leone filmed Terrifier on a low-budget of $35k. It had an Indiegogo campaign, although it ultimately did not reach its goal. 
Mike Giannelli, who portrayed all prior incarnations of Art, retired from acting before production began, and Thornton replaced him as Art. It premiered at the Telluride Horror Show Film Festival in October 2016 before being picked up by Dread Central Presents and Epic Pictures for a limited theatrical release in March 2018. The film received mixed reviews, with praise directed towards the special effects and the portrayals of Kanell and Thornton, while the writing was subject to criticism. The movie quickly became a cult film. A sequel, Terrifier 2, was released on October 6, 2022.
