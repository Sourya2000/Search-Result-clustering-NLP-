The citrange (a portmanteau of citrus and orange) is a citrus hybrid of the sweet orange and the trifoliate orange.
The purpose of this cross was to attempt to create a cold hardy citrus tree (which is the nature of a trifoliate), with delicious fruit like those of the sweet orange. However, citranges are generally bitter.
Citrange is used as a rootstock for citrus in Morocco, but does not prevent dry root rot or exocortis disease.
