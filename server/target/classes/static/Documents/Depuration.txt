Depuration of seafood is the process by which marine or freshwater animals are placed into a clean water environment for a period of time to allow purging of biological contaminants (such as Escherichia coli) and physical impurities (such as sand and silt).   The most common subjects of depuration are bivalves such as oysters, clams, and mussels.
