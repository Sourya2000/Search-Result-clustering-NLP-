Eventful is an online calendar and events discovery service owned by Audacy, Inc. The service allows users to search for and track upcoming entertainment events in their area (such as concerts, festivals, and film presentations) involving specific performers, indicate and share their intent to attend certain events, and indicate their "demand" for certain acts to appear in their region. As of February 2021, the site has been replaced by a link to Entercom's radio.com site, which includes a limited music-event-listing functionality.
