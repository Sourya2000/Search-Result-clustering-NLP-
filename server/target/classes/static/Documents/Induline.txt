Induline is a dye of blue, bluish-red or black shades. Induline consists of a mixture of several intensely colored species, so the name is often indulines. It was one of the first synthetic dyes, discovered in 1863 by J. Dale and Heinrich Caro.  The main components of induline are various substituted phenazines.  Although induline no longer in use, the related dye nigrosin is still produced commercially.
