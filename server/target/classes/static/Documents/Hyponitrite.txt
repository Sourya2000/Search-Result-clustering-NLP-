In chemistry, hyponitrite may refer to the anion N2O2−2 ([ON=NO]2−), or to any ionic compound that contains it.  In organic chemistry, it may also refer to the group −O−N=N−O−, or any organic compound with the generic formula R1−O−N=N−O−R2, where R1 and R2 are organic groups.  Such compounds can be viewed as salts and esters of respectively hyponitrous acid H2N2O2 or HON=NOH.
An acid hyponitrite is an ionic compound with the anion HN2O−2 ([HON=NO]−).
