A hammercloth is a large decorative piece of heavy weatherproof fabric, often fringed and richly adorned with embroidery, gemstones, and cloth of gold, placed over and around the seat of the coachman of a state or family horse and carriage.  A hammercloth might display the arms or other emblems of the heritage of the owner of the coach.
