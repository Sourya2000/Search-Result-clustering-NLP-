A nociceptor (from Latin  nocere 'to harm or hurt'; lit.â€‰'pain receptor') is a sensory neuron that responds to damaging or potentially damaging stimuli by sending "possible threat" signals to the spinal cord and the brain. The brain creates the sensation of pain to direct attention to the body part, so the threat can be mitigated; this process is called nociception.
