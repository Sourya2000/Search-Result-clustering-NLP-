In anatomy, the meninges (, SG: meninx ( or ), from Ancient Greek  μῆνιγξ (mēninx) 'membrane') are the three membranes that envelop the brain and spinal cord. In mammals, the meninges are the dura mater, the arachnoid mater, and the pia mater. Cerebrospinal fluid is located in the subarachnoid space between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater. The primary function of the meninges is to protect the central nervous system.
