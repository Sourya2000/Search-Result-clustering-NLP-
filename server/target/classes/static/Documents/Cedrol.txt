Cedrol is a sesquiterpene alcohol found in the essential oil of conifers (cedar oil), especially in the genera Cupressus (cypress) and Juniperus (juniper). It has also been identified in Origanum onites, a plant related to oregano. Its main uses are in the chemistry of aroma compounds. It makes up about 19% of cedarwood oil Texas and 15.8% of cedarwood oil Virginia.Cedrol has not been proven to be toxic in humans. It has been shown to have antioxidant and antiinflammatory along with other beneficial effects. In skin sensitization tests 2/20 people showed negative effects, and on the second test there was no sensitivity found. This compound and ones similar have been found to have antiseptic, anti-inflammatory, antispasmodic, tonic, astringent, diuretic, sedative, insecticidal, and antifungal activities in vitro. These compounds are used globally in traditional medicine and cosmetics. Results of a 2015 study suggest that cedrol strongly attracts pregnant female mosquitoes after they have fed, which can be used to create cedrol-baited traps.
