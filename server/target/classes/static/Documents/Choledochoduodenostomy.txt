Choledochoduodenostomy (CDD) is a surgical procedure to create an anastomosis, a surgical connection, between the common bile duct (CBD) and an alternative portion of the duodenum. In healthy individuals, the CBD meets the pancreatic duct at the ampulla of Vater, which drains via the major duodenal papilla to the second part of duodenum. In cases of benign conditions such as narrowing of the distal CBD or recurrent CBD stones, performing a CDD provides the diseased patient with CBD drainage and decompression. A side-to-side anastomosis is usually performed.Bile from the gallbladder is carried to the CBD and emptied into the duodenum. CBD drainage might be obstructed due to distal CBD stricture, which is narrowing of the CBD due to the presence of scar tissue within the duct, and choledocholithiasis, the presence of gallstones. Obstruction can occur when gallstones may be too large to pass through the CBD into the duodenum.Liver tests are performed before and after the operation. During surgery, the duodenum should be repositioned in close proximity with the CBD to ensure a tension-free anastomosis. 8 incisions are made, with one in the CBD and one in the duodenum. Sutures are performed between the incisions to create a new pathway. Postoperative complications include inflammation and narrowing within the surgical site and sump syndrome. Given that the duodenum is in a diseased state, or a tension-free anastomosis cannot be created, a CDD should not be performed and alternative bypass procedures could be considered.
Currently, CDD accounts for approximately 1% of all biliary operations to provide CBD drainage. 38% of the patients undergo CDD as a primary operation (first treatment given for a disease) and 60% of the patients undergo CDD as a secondary procedure (a surgical procedure which is performed to improve conditions found to exist during the primary surgery). CDD is more often performed in the elderly with the mean age of the patients being around 61 years.
