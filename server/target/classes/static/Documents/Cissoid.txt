In geometry, a cissoid ((from Ancient Greek  κισσοειδής (kissoeidēs) 'ivy-shaped') is a plane curve generated from two given curves C1, C2 and a point O (the pole). Let L be a variable line passing through O and intersecting C1 at P1 and C2 at P2. Let P be the point on L so that 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              O
              P
            
            ¯
          
        
        =
        
          
            
              
                P
                
                  1
                
              
              
                P
                
                  2
                
              
            
            ¯
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\overline {OP}}={\overline {P_{1}P_{2}}}.}
   (There are actually two such points but P is chosen so that P is in the same direction from O as P2 is from P1.) Then the locus of such points P is defined to be the cissoid of the curves C1, C2 relative to O.
Slightly different but essentially equivalent definitions are used by different authors. For example, P may be defined to be the point so that 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              O
              P
            
            ¯
          
        
        =
        
          
            
              O
              
                P
                
                  1
                
              
            
            ¯
          
        
        +
        
          
            
              O
              
                P
                
                  2
                
              
            
            ¯
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\overline {OP}}={\overline {OP_{1}}}+{\overline {OP_{2}}}.}
   This is equivalent to the other definition if C1 is replaced by its reflection through O. Or P may be defined as the midpoint of P1 and P2; this produces the curve generated by the previous curve scaled by a factor of 1/2.
