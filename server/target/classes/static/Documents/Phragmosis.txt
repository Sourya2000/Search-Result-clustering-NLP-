Phragmosis is any method by which an animal defends itself in its burrow, by using its own body as a barrier. This term was originally coined by W.M. Wheeler (1927), while describing the defensive technique exhibited by insects. Wheeler observed the positioning of specially modified body structures to block nest entrances, as exhibited in various insect species. The term phragmosis has since been further extended beyond just insects.
Examples of phragmosis are found in the order Anura (frogs and toads). Some species, such as Pternohyla fodiens and Corythomantis greeningi, have evolved a peculiarly casqued head adapted to protect the animal as it backs down a hole. Another example is the head-plug defense used by the aphid Astegopteryx sp., in which a banana-bunch shaped gall consisting of several subgalls is used as a barrier. Arguably, the most commonly observed phragmotic behaviour is within the ant family. The behaviour is displayed in numerous taxa such as Camponotus, Colobostruma, Crematogaster, Pheidole, Blepharidatta, Cephalotes pusillus, Carebara elmenteitae, Stenamma expolitum, in which the soldiers have unusually large, disc-shaped heads, which are used to block nest entrances against intruders.
