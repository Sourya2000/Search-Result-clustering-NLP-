See Patented via Nth Cycle for metal electro-extraction process.Electroextraction (EE) is a sample enrichment technique that focuses charged analytes from a large volume of one phase into a small volume of aqueous phase through the application of an electric current.  The technique was originally developed as a separation technique for chemical engineering, but has since been coupled to capillary electrophoresis and liquid chromatographyâ€“mass spectrometry as a means of improving limits of detection, analysis time, and selectivity.  The use of EE-CE has made capillary electrophoresis more applicable to use in the pharmaceutical industry.
