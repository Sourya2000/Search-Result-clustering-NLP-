Pelagial is the sixth studio album by German progressive metal band The Ocean. It is a concept album with the track titles referencing, in descending fashion, the oceanic depth zones.  Musically, the concept is explored by sequencing the music such that it is increasingly dark and claustrophobic in emulation of the diminishing light and increasing pressure that comes with oceanic descent.  The album was initially conceived as an instrumental release, although vocals were subsequently added; the band has made both versions available.
Pelagial was released in Germany on 26 April 2013, in Europe on 29 April, and in North America on 30 April. The album entered the German Album Chart at No. 68 and is the band's first charting album.
