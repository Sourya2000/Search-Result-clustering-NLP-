Aluminosilicate refers to materials containing anionic Si-O-Al linkages. Commonly, the associate cations are sodium (Na+), potassium (K+) and protons (H+). Such materials occur as  minerals and as synthetic materials, often in the form of zeolites.  Both synthetic and natural aluminosilicates are of technical significance as structural materials, catalysts, and reagents.
