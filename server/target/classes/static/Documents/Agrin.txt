Agrin is a large proteoglycan whose best-characterised role is in the development of the neuromuscular junction during embryogenesis. Agrin is named based on its involvement in the aggregation of acetylcholine receptors during synaptogenesis.  In humans, this protein is encoded by the AGRN gene.This protein has nine domains homologous to protease inhibitors. It may also have functions in other tissues and during other stages of development.  It is a major proteoglycan component in the glomerular basement membrane and may play a role in the renal filtration and cell-matrix interactions.Agrin functions by activating the MuSK protein (for Muscle-Specific Kinase),  which is a receptor tyrosine kinase required for the formation and maintenance of the neuromuscular junction. Agrin is required to activate MuSK. Agrin is also required for neuromuscular junction formation.
