The ProTide technology is a prodrug approach used in molecular biology and drug design. It is designed to deliver nucleotide analogues (as monophosphate) into the cell (ProTide: PROdrug + nucleoTIDE). This technology was invented by Professor Chris McGuigan from the School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences at Cardiff University in the early 1990s. ProTides form a critical part of antiviral drugs such as sofosbuvir, tenofovir alafenamide, and remdesivir.
