A washcloth, wash cloth, or flannel (British English) is a rectangular piece of cloth used to aid in washing the body. It can be used to apply or rinse off soap or shower gel, and provides additional friction to remove dirt or dead skin from the body. Washcloths are especially useful in situations where little water is available or preferred, such as washing at a sink, or in patient/caregiver settings.
Washcloths are typically made of terrycloth and measure around 12" inches square. A sub-variant of the washcloth is the washing mitt, a terrycloth pouch open on one side to allow the user's hand to fit inside.
