A teamster in American English is a truck driver; a person who drives teams of draft animals; or a member of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, a labor union. In some places, a teamster was called a carter, the name referring to the bullock cart. 
Originally the term teamster meant a person who drove a team, usually of oxen, horses, or mules, pulling a wagon, replacing the earlier teamer.This term was common by the time of the Mexicanâ€“American War (1848) and the Indian Wars throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries on the American frontier.
Another name for the occupation was bullwhacker, related to driving oxen. A teamster might also drive pack animals, such as a muletrain, in which case he was also called a muleteer or muleskinner.  Today this person may be called an outfitter or packer.In Australian English, a teamster was also called a bullocker or bullocky and was sometimes used to denote a carrier.From the Revolutionary War at least through World War I, United States Army enlisted personnel responsible for transporting supplies by wagon and for the upkeep of those draft animals were called wagoners.
