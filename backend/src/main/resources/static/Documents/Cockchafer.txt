The common cockchafer (Melolontha melolontha), colloquially called the Maybug, Maybeetle, or doodlebug, is a species of scarab beetle belonging to the genus Melolontha native to Europe. It is one of several closely related and morphologically similar species of Melolontha called cockchafers, alongside Melolontha hippocastani (the forest cockchafer). The adults and larvae feed on plants, and are regarded as serious agricultural pests of crops such as grasses and fruit trees.
