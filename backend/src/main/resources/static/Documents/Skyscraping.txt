Skyscraping is the seventh studio album by English pop band ABC, released in March 1997 by Blatant and Deconstruction. The album was produced as a homage to lead singer Martin Fry's several musical heroes, including David Bowie, Roxy Music and the Sex Pistols.It is their first album without founding member, keyboardist and guitarist Mark White, who had up until that point been heavily involved in the composition and production of their work. As the line-up of ABC without White consisted solely of Fry, Glenn Gregory of Heaven 17 and Keith Lowndes were brought in as songwriting and performance collaborators. The album was met with positive reviews from critics but little commercial success.
Three singles were released: "Stranger Things", "Skyscraping" and "Rolling Sevens". An expanded 2CD edition of the album was released by Cherry Red Records on 23 September 2013.In September 2022 the album was finally released on Spotify and other digital platforms.
