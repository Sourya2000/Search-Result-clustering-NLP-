Magnesioferrite is a magnesium iron oxide mineral, a member of the magnetite series of spinels. 
Magnesioferrite crystallizes as black metallic octahedral crystals. It is named after its chemical composition of magnesium and ferric iron.
The density is 4.6 - 4.7 (average = 4.65), and the diaphaniety is opaque. Occurs as well-formed fine sized crystals or massive and granular. 
Its hardness is  6-6.5. It has a metallic luster and a dark red streak.
